Airports RFP Documentation

1. First thing isto find the total amount of flights. Because of the datamart that we have this is 
going to segment itself in a table.

TotalFlights = SUM(fFlights[Flights])


2. Second thing is to find the toatl flights in ATL Region.  

TotalFlights for Atlantic Canada = 
CALCULATE([TotalFlights], 'Airports'[Region] IN { "Atlantic Canada" })


3. Dividing the two we'll  have a percentage of the total segmented by year.

% ATL = [TotalFlights for Atlantic Canada]/[TotalFlights]


4. In order to have a percentage of yearly results we need alocked flights amount. The 
ALL filter is not going to allow any filter to work on that number.

LockedFlights = CALCULATE([TotalFlights], ALL(fFlights))


5. Next you just divide it in order to have the percentage required.

% Total Flights = [TotalFlights]/[LockedFlights]


6. The segmented flights will show us the % using all the filters in the model. The ALLSELECTED
filter is going to be the responsible for that. 

SegmentedFlights = CALCULATE([TotalFlights], ALLSELECTED(fFlights))


7. Dividing in order to achieve the dinamic %

% Segmented = [TotalFlights]/[SegmentedFlights]


8. Year over YEAR using quick measures.

YoY% = 
IF(
	ISFILTERED('Months'[Custom]),
	ERROR("Time intelligence quick measures can only be grouped or filtered by the Power BI-provided date hierarchy or primary date column."),
	VAR __PREV_YEAR = CALCULATE([TotalFlights], DATEADD('Months'[Custom].[Date], -1, YEAR))
	RETURN
		DIVIDE([TotalFlights] - __PREV_YEAR, __PREV_YEAR)
)


9. Month over Month using quick measures.

MoM% = 
IF(
	ISFILTERED('Months'[Custom]),
	ERROR("Time intelligence quick measures can only be grouped or filtered by the Power BI-provided date hierarchy or primary date column."),
	VAR __PREV_MONTH = CALCULATE([TotalFlights], DATEADD('Months'[Custom].[Date], -1, MONTH))
	RETURN
		DIVIDE([TotalFlights] - __PREV_MONTH, __PREV_MONTH)
)


10. YTD Constant sums all the flights that we had yaer over year without filters.

Accumulated Flights = CALCULATE([TotalFlights],Filter(All(Months),Months[Custom]<=MAX(Months[Custom])))


11. YTD Dinamic, works with all the filters in the model.

Accumulated Flights = CALCULATE([TotalFlights],Filter(AllSELECTED(Months),Months[Custom]<=MAX(Months[Custom])))
